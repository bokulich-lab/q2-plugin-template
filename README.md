# q2-plugin-template
A skeleton for QIIME 2 plugins.

To use this template for a new plugin creation, you'll need to adjust the following elements:

- exchange `plugin_name` and `plugin-name` with the name of your plugin
- add versioneer support:
    - install versioneer (link): `pip install versioneer`
    - run `versioneer install`

Enjoy!
